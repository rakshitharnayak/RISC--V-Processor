# RISC--V-Processor

In the RISC V processor, the term RISC stands for “reduced instruction set computer” which executes few computer instructions whereas ‘V’ stands for the 5th generation. It is an open-source hardware ISA (instruction set architecture) based on the established principle of RISC.

Here we are going to design the process using RISC V
## Problem Statement: Design an ALU to implement the below operations:
1) Addition 
2) Substraction
3) Logical operations (OR, AND, XOR) 
4) Comparison

### Solution:
In this project we implement a 32-bit, RISC-V ISA based processor in verilog. The sub-modules that are used and their interaction with each other are shown in the following picture.
